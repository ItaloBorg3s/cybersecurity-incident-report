# **Cybersecurity Incident Report** üõ°Ô∏è

## **Overview**

This repository contains my ongoing cybersecurity project, which focuses on analyzing a security incident. The project involves using **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, and **Shell Scripting** to investigate a network security issue, specifically a **SYN Flood attack**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge and develop skills in **incident response**, **network traffic analysis**, and **security best practices**.

## **üö® Incident Description**

### **Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption**

One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is a **DoS (Denial of Service) attack**, specifically a **SYN Flood**. This type of attack aims to overwhelm the target server by sending numerous **SYN packets** in quick succession. The **logs show** that the web server became unresponsive after receiving a high volume of these packets, causing the server to be unable to process new legitimate connection requests.

This event could be categorized as a **Layer 3** or **Layer 4 attack** in the OSI model, specifically a **SYN Flood DoS attack**.

---

### **Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction**

When website visitors attempt to establish a connection with the web server, a **three-way handshake** occurs using the **TCP protocol**. This handshake is made up of three steps:

1. **SYN (Synchronize)**: The client sends a request to establish a connection.
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)**: The server responds with an acknowledgment.
3. **ACK (Acknowledge)**: The client sends an acknowledgment back to the server to complete the handshake.

In a **SYN Flood attack**, a malicious actor sends a **large number of SYN packets** all at once. The server reserves resources for each incoming SYN request, but since the attacker never completes the handshake (doesn‚Äôt send the ACK), the connections remain **half-open**. As a result, the server's resources become exhausted, preventing it from processing legitimate connection requests and causing a **website malfunction**.

---

### **Section 3: Explain what the logs indicate and how that affects the server**

The logs indicate a significant increase in **half-open connections**, where the server is holding resources for connections that are never completed. This causes the server to run out of available connections, leading to a **server timeout**. 

As a result, legitimate users attempting to connect to the website are unable to establish a connection and instead receive a **connection timeout error message**. This is a direct consequence of the **SYN Flood attack**, where the attacker effectively exhausts the server‚Äôs connection capacity by flooding it with incomplete handshakes.
